# Keyword Monitor
Monitors website for specific keywords
Previously was used to monitor websites for products such as monitor releases, Hypewear, In-Stock keyboards with successful rates.
However proxies tend to be clipped due it being TOR public nodes.
Decided to open source it for help in improving the product and for public use.

This was successfully ran with UNIX in the cloud but it can be setup for residential.

## Setting up
Install all prerequisites
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Set up your webhook_url via the environment file (.env)
```
WEBHOOK_URL=<DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL>
PROD=
TOR_PASS=
```

You will need a cron job to set up the application
```
crontab -e
/Users/username/Documents/python/page-monitor/runner.py >> /Users/username/Documents/python/page-monitor/cron.log 2>&1
```
Note: You might need to allow cron to access your files

## Setting up in TOR proxies
https://jarroba.com/anonymous-scraping-by-tor-network/#:~:text=The%20most%20common%20use%20case,can%20continue%20scraping%20this%20website.

```
sudo apt-get install privoxy or brew install privoxy
sudo apt-get install python-stem or pip3 install stem
sudo apt-get install tor or brew install tor
```

### Setting up TOR

Password Hashing:
`tor --hash-password my_password`

Control Files

`sudo vim /etc/tor/torrc` and change the file to (Ubuntu)

`cp /usr/local/etc/tor/torrc.sample /usr/local/etc/tor/torrc` (OSX)
`sudo vim /usr/local/etc/tor/torrc` and change the file to

```
ControlPort 9051
# hashed password below is obtained via `tor --hash-password my_password`
HashedControlPassword 16:9529EB03A306DE6F60171DE514EA2FCD49235BAF1E1E55897209679683
CookieAuthentication 1
```

Restart service client
`sudo /etc/init.d/tor restart` (Ubuntu)
`sudo brew services start tor` (OSX)

### Setting up Privoxy
Changing Control files:
```
sudo vim /etc/privoxy/config (ubuntu)
vim /usr/local/etc/privoxy/config (osx)
```
Uncomment this line
```
forward-socks5 / 127.0.0.1:9050
```

Restart Service client
```
sudo /etc/init.d/privoxy restart (ubuntu)
brew services restart privoxy (osx)
```


## Usage
```
# to see syntax
./runner.py -h
python3 main.py -h

# sample
./runner.py multiReader "https://www.helloworld.com.au" "keyword" "https://www.helloworld.com.au" helloworld <optional-env-variable>

python3 main.py proxyReader "https://www.site.com" "Add to Cart" "tester" "span" "submit.button"

# running feed
python3 mainFeed.py "https://www.site.com.au/feed" 
python3 mainFeed.py "https://www.site.com.au/feed" "keyword1,keyword2"
```

### Current Features
#### main.py
- reader: monitor selective elements for keywords
- proxyReader: uses TOR and selective elements and ids
- mainFeed: monitors feed and print out the latest items including necessary keywords

#### runner.py
- multiReader: monitor selective words in the whole page

### Deprecated
- Finder: verifies if the keyword exist
- ForeverFinder: verifies if the keyword exist in a forever loop (TBD)
- Difference: verifies if there is a difference to the website from the last call 
- differenceMultiple: differences via any text element based on keyword matches 
- differenceMultipleId: differences via the id element based on keyword matches 
- differencePage: any page differences (javascript elements change often)
- multiReader: combination of readers from the top to one
- proxyReader: uses TOR and selective elements and ids
- mainFeed: monitors feed and print out the latest items


## Future Upgrades
- Utilise forever functions and proper failover mechanisms
- Setting up databases for mutliple monitors to query
- Add logging
- Use argparse for arguments
- Improve README documentation

## Tech Debt
- Clean up inferior functions
- It should be running forever functions or as a service instead
- Add more descriptive subroutine names
- Move multireader to main.py
- Remove all deprecated code (should not be stored in deprecated fodler)
